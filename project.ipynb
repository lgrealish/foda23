    "\n",
    "Iris flower data, also known as Fisher's Iris dataset was introduced by British biologist and statistician Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher. In 1936, Sir Fisher published a report titled [“The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x) in the journal Annals of Eugenics. In this article, Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. It was the first time that the sepal and petal measures of the three Iris species as mentioned above appeared publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a multivariate data set of 50 samples which the author gathered on each of three species of Irises: setosa, versicolor and virginica. Measurements of 4 properties of 50 flowers of each of the plants were taken, namely Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal Length, and Petal width. The author suggests that the petal and sepal lengths and widths are characteristics which can be used to identify which species they belong to based on a linear discriminant modelLinear discriminant analysis. Fisher himself developed the linear discriminant model, a statistical, machine learning and pattern recognition technique used to distinguish between two or more objects, classes or events. Iris Data set wikipedia Fisher presented the data for the 3 species in a table with each of the four measurements and subsequently, tables of observed means, sums of squares etc. in order to demonstrate how each species can be discriminated from one another."
